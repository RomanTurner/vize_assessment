# VIZE Assessment

The feedback form is just styled after the phone app design.
I wanted to show that I could follow a design pattern if it was sent to me. 

- I used the fonts family, sizes, and colors. 
- I used Material Ui to quickly mock up the design so some edge cases are not exact to the figma, but the style could be overridden. 
- The image is a hacky solution, again to just mirror the design with the time limit. I didn't want to spend more than a couple hours as per our communication. 

**I am wanting to see how you would handle the state for the form without using a third party library.**


-[x] Used React Hooks to create a controlled form component. 


**What would (I) do for validation on the front-end etc.**


-[x] I used material ui textarea validations for required fields. 
Notes: This is a very simple form that only has text data and without many edge cases so I let the requirements handle the validations. 
If I had the sections available I would create a select from all of the sections in order to help the user not input an incorrect section. 



**mocking of an API request, and how you would handle something like that.** 
-[x] Created an example of how I would use the Fetch API if I had a valid end point.
In lieu of an API endpoint I used the loading component and a setTimeout for the submit button. 

**If I had More Time**


When two hours hit I was just about to start testing. 
Notes: With using material ui, a heavily tested framework a lot of the typical jest tests wouldn't be necessary but I would have liked 
to use the react testing library to have some test coverage.
